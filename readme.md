## MLA7 Citation Generator

### Project Inspiration

I used too use [citationmachine](http://citationmachine.net/) to generate my MLA7. However it was really annoying to use and took a lot of time. So I simply wrote a detailed script to generate the same level of MLA7. 

### Where can I view a live demo of my site

You can view the demo at my [github page](https://www.fschatbot.github.io/MLA7)! I plan to add CSS and a simple config machine later on.

### How I Generate my own Citation

It's actually pretty simple. First I reverse engiered their API and simply wrote a small script to understand the JSON response. Then I wrote a script to generate the citation.

### Credits

Again because i use [citationmachine](http://citationmachine.net/) to generate my MLA7, I have no affliation with them.
