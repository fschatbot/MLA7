## Project Inspiration

I used too use [citationmachine](http://citationmachine.net/) to generate my MLA7. However it was really annoying to use and took a lot of time. So I simply wrote a detailed script to generate the same level of MLA7.

## Where can I view a live demo of my site

You can view the demo at my [github page](https://fschatbot.github.io/MLA7/)! I plan to add CSS and a simple config machine later on.

## How I Generate my own Citation

It's actually pretty simple. First I reverse engiered their API and simply wrote a small script to understand the JSON response. Then I wrote a script to generate the citation.

## Credits

Again because i use [citationmachine](http://citationmachine.net/) to generate my MLA7, I have no affliation with them.

### TODO

- Make the CSS be compatibile with Mobile Phones
- Add a configuration option to change how the MLA7 is generated
- Add a dark mode
